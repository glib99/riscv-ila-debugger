This repository has a makefile modified with a rule to create a rocket sd card image
with a debug core instantiated and connected to the user specified nets.

The repository structure is modeled after the rocket fpga-zynq directory; you can copy
the makefile/makefrag into their respective locations in your cloned repo and follow
the instructions.

run this command from your respective board subdirectory:

make fpga-images-with-ila-$(BOARD)/boot.bin CONFIG=$(CONFIG) DEBUGNET0=first_net_to_debug [DEBUGNET1=second_net_to_debug] [DEBUGNET2=third_net_to_debug] [DEBUGNET3=fourth_net_to_debug]

Up to 4 debug nets are supported with this makefile, on one debug core.
More can be added if needed.
the output will be in the fpga-images-$(BOARD) subdirectory. 
The files can be copied directly to the sd card and the board can be booted directly from there.

A modified makefile for the zedboard has been created in the zedboard subdirectory.
If you would like to use this makefile with another board, add the following to 
the respective makefile in the same way:

DEBUGNET0 ?= 
DEBUGNET1 ?= NoDebugNet1
DEBUGNET2 ?= NoDebugNet2
DEBUGNET3 ?= NoDebugNet3
